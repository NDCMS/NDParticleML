This a reposity with modifications made to the simple neural network found [here](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1wpLKRUaBxlfWDmyL9czZ8WP-_4W60Vxh?usp=sharing). This model seaks to model differnt function while exploring some critical questions. 

### What is being explored?
* How many layers/nodes do you need to do a '***good enough***' job of learning that function?
* How long does it take to train each function?
* Does it work over the full range of inputs? 
  * How do you characterize the '***full range***' of a function?
  * Will the '***goodness***' of a function change when the range changes?
