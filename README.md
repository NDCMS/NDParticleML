This a reposity with modifications made to the simple neural network found at

[Base Model](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1wpLKRUaBxlfWDmyL9czZ8WP-_4W60Vxh?usp=sharing)

This model is tries to learn the function f(x)=x for a set of 3 inputs. 

### To-Do List
- [x] Modify the model to learn the function f(x)=x<sup>2</sup> for a set of 3 inputs
- [ ] Run the training example(s) on the GPU
- [ ] Make plots that show how well the network is reproducing the outputs that we expect using a number of randomly generated test points.
- [ ] Make loss curves for training (training and testing)
- [ ] Add some code to handle standardization of inputs and outputs (and then test it on examples where the inputs have different distributions)
- [ ] Make a plot of the weights in the model
