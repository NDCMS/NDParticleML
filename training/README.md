# Training

This folder contains current NN training code. Make sure to include all files to be transferred in `train.submit`! Also, check the graph and model saving lines in `train.py` if you want to convert it to a notebook or vice versa, otherwise they might not save correctly.

Note: The current training set is at `/scratch365/klannon/dnnlikelihood/likelihood_data_no_delta.npz`. A copy can also be found on CurateND.
