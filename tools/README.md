# Tools

This folder contains current NN tools. Primarily, it inclues the `convert_combine_root_to_numpy.ipynb` notebook. This notebook converts root files to numpy files, since the NN reads in numpy files. To use this notebook, you will need the package uproot. If you do not have it, in the jupyter notebook, you can install it by typing '!pip install uproot' in a cell.
