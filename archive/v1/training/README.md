# Training

This folder contains NN training code at the end of summer 2021. Make sure to include all files to be transferred in `likelihood.submit`! Also, check the graph and model saving lines in `likelihood.py` if you want to convert it to a notebook or vice versa, otherwise they might not save correctly.
